		<div>Let me share a story with you; sit back and relax for this one. Once upon a time there was a really successful social media platform called MySpace. In fact, it was the largest social networking platform in the world. At the time, it proved to be a radical new ‘thing’. Without much competition it spent little time on new innovations and product development. Then, Facebook came along... the end; well of MySpace anyway! Now, imagine what the past would have looked like if the future had happened sooner. But what if it did and like My Space you just failed to keep up? How do you keep up with now if you're already one step behind? And how you can possibly be thinking of the future, if this is the case? Let’s take a look at how you can align innovation to your business for a more focused future.

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:Understand the importance of innovation and the impact it can have on business successDevelop strategies for innovation across different areas of the businessIdentify barriers to innovation and implement strategies to overcome themPrepare the business to embrace innovation as part of the culture</div>

Check out these nine key attributes that get you in the running:Management qualityQuality of products/services offeredInnovativenessValue as a long term investmentSoundness of financial positionAbility to attract, develop and retain talentCommunity responsibilityWise use of corporate assetsEffectiveness in conducting a global business
If you weren’t sure how important innovation was before, you can certainly see now how highly it’s regarded in the business world. Feeling far from making the cut when it comes to innovation? That’s ok, the whole point of innovation is that we develop changes to positively impact our future. Rather than dwell on what isn’t, we can work towards what is, and what can be.

When companies fail to innovate, it’s very unlikely the cause is a lack of ideas. One likely scenario is that all of the great ideas are just sitting around in people’s heads going nowhere. If this is the case, it’s usually due to something in the work environment or culture that’s holding them back. Worse still is that the ideas are out there, but quickly fizzle out and die. This can happen when ideas lack focus and direction. We can get caught up in the idea itself and emphasise the ‘wow’ factor before the ‘how’.

The trick is to align your innovation strategy to your company purpose. This creates ideas that are more meaningful. You can see their reason for being and how they will add value to your business. If you want a culture of innovation, then motivating team members by allowing them to find purpose and achievement in their work, is essential.</div>
		<div>What you want to avoid is an innovation strategy that’s just ‘bolted’ on to the side of your business. To help, consider these activities for a more integrated approach.

Express clear aspirations for innovation.

If you want to inspire and motivate your team to innovate, provide them with a clear purpose. Everyone knows that innovation is a requirement for remaining competitive but be clear on the specifics. Do you have fierce competitors that push you to be first to market (think Apple vs Samsung)? Or perhaps you need to create a point of difference for a product that has become commonplace (think Nestle to Nespresso)? Ask yourself, are you a disruptor in your sector? If not, think about how you can shake things up.

Define and align your goals to your overall strategy.

When your aspirations are clear, it’s then about breaking them down into meaningful goals that everyone can own. If I’m on your frontline what can I do in my role to drive innovation? How am I personally part of the growth of the organisation? Communicate how everyone in the business plays a role.</div>
		<div>Search for the good stuff.

Reach out and discover where ‘good’ is happening in your business. Where is best practice being demonstrated? What capabilities do you have? Create internal ‘think tanks’ at every level to capture and explore ideas. Maintain a focus on the positive; what is working and what you do have so that ideas don’t get clogged with negative mindsets.

Stimulate knowledge sharing.

Make knowledge and innovation capital your priority and create processes to share this knowledge across your entire organisation. When you increase collaboration, and promote knowledge sharing with a team that has diverse backgrounds and perspectives, you will ultimately foster creativity and innovation.

Be open to looking outside for the expertise that you may need.

Avoid looking outside your organisation and you risk the biggest killer of innovation: “it’s the way we’ve always done it.” Getting contributions and insights from outside your organisation can really help to shape a culture that supports collaboration and sharing of ideas. Sharing with external partners allows you to co-create at a level that takes you beyond the boundaries of your own business.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Create your vision for innovation.

An ‘innovation vision’ is a statement that allows you to define what innovation will do for your business. To help you to create your vision, ask yourself questions like:

What type of company will we be in 10 years if we follow the direction we have outlined?

If we were featured on the cover of Time magazine as the most admired company in the world – what would it say?

What must we do to remain relevant in the years to come?

Ensure that innovation is not a separate strategy.

When you’re clear about your innovation purpose and share it across the whole organisation, it won’t be difficult to make it part of day-to-day practices. Every meeting, focus group and decision has an element of innovative thinking; it becomes the norm. Ensure that innovation isn’t something people do ‘on top of’ their job. This means always being open to asking “is this the best way?”</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS ••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS ••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>All this talk of innovation and I know what you might be thinking, “But seriously, my business is never going to come up with the next Google Glasses!” I hear what you’re saying. Technology like that requires knowledge, creativity, resources, finances and time. But that doesn’t mean we do nothing, no way! I’m not letting you off that easy.

There are many different types of Innovation. It's just about understanding what you’re trying to achieve and how you can use innovation to get you there. If you want to be the next ‘big thing’ then, yeah, you might need a suitcase full of money and a team full of experts. But then again, you might not. It might be as simple as helping the team understand your vision for innovation and guiding their ideas into new initiatives.

Let’s take a look at four different types of innovation. In an ideal world, your innovation strategy would be a combination of a few. Whether your aim is to ‘go big or go home’ or to just do the small stuff to get you a little further ahead, the key is to just do it. There’s really no reason not to.</div>
		<div>WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS ••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>All those updates running on your smartphone are exactly the kind of thing we’re talking about here. A bug fix here, a more streamlined process there. Incremental innovation is small, sustainable, cost effective and manageable.</div>
		<div>INCREMENTAL INNOVATION
Looking for small, sustainable change? This is the type of innovation for you. This is really about those incremental changes that companies need to achieve to stay relevant and retain their customers. It’s looking at your current product or service and developing newer, more up-to-date versions. This type of innovation focuses on continuous improvement; appealing to your most valuable customers and works within your current processes and culture. This can sometimes be about extending the lifecycle of a breakthrough product, where profitability is maximised and the value proposition steadily improves. Not only that, but changing the small stuff can actually lead to bigger stuff. Why? Because you’re getting your team to think about change as a ‘natural’ thing. They’ll feel more confident to offer their thoughts and ideas to better your products and services. This builds team motivation to innovate more and more!

</div>
		<div>WHO'S DOING IT?</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS ••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>We’ve already thrown out Google as an innovation leader. You know it and I know it; they’re always shaking things up. While industry always catches up some way in the end, they continue to push for that next thing that we didn’t even know we needed!</div>
		<div>BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATION
Breakthrough innovation is exactly the stuff most of us imagine when we think about innovation. In a modern market that’s moving so fast, everyone’s looking to strike it big. This type of approach generally represents a significant change in performance, technology and value provided to the end user. For businesses that charge a premium to their customers, there is a need to deliver premium value, and this type of innovation is vital to their success. Look to breakthrough innovation if you want to drive your industry forward and become a leader within it. To do it well, you’ll need to be bold, futuristic, and think big.

</div>
		<div>NEED AN EXAMPLE?</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS ••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>The HBR article, ‘Creating new market space’, highlights Starbucks as an example. In the 1980’s, coffee was considered a commodity that consumers drank daily and shopping for coffee was centred mostly on price. Starbucks decided to turn coffee drinking from a functional experience into an emotional experience. Looking at it from a consumer perspective, drinking coffee was usually done in the company of others in, for example, tearooms and meetings. Starbucks took this idea and turned their coffee bars into places for people to gather, be seen, relax and have conversations. Starbucks turned ordinary people into coffee connoisseurs, who were willing to pay (at the time) steep prices for their daily ‘cup of jo’. High margin and growth followed; along with the half strength, decaf, soy latte culture.</div>
		<div>NEW MARKET INNOVATION
Sick of the cat and mouse game with your competitors? Maybe new market innovation is just what you need. New market innovation is all about putting a focus on those consumers who don’t currently exist in your market. It may be, for example a particular consumer who doesn’t currently use your product or a geographical location you’re looking to enter. In this case, innovation is about looking at what you already know, but from a different angle. Why? Because a focus on competing with your competition is just a focus on how to ‘one-up’ them, meaning at some point you’re always going to end up in the same place.

To do this well, you need to think less like yourself or your competitors and more like your consumers. There’s potentially a whole new market out there that you and your competitors have completely ignored. A move towards this new market can create focus and growth in that area, meaning competition sets back in, but by that stage, you’re already ahead of the game.

</div>
		<div>WHO'S DONE THIS WELL?</div>
		<div>Netflix is an online company that has revolutionised the streaming of all types of video entertainment to their customers. It’s forcing change within the industry of entertainment, with on-demand movies, TV shows and documentaries. Netflix is driving the need for customer convenience and instant, affordable access to entertainment.</div>
		<div>DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION
Disruptive innovation happens when the ‘movers and shakers’ change the basis for competition in an industry. These are innovations that invade the market, force change and create new sectors. Usually this happens when a better product or service emerges at a cheaper price, than those existing already. This creates opportunities for success that is both dramatic for the business and disruptive to the market. Often startups are successful because they simplify the user experience; they lower product costs and open them up to a wider market. Disruptive innovation is often described as a simple, low cost solution to your customers’ problems.</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS ••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>Without even realising it, your organisation could be creating unexpected barriers to your innovation strategy. You might want it, and know you need it, but internal practices are getting in the way. By identifying and acknowledging that these barriers exist you can avoid many of these obstacles. Here are some of the most common sucker punches we throw:</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS ••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS ••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>“I’ll let you know when I’ve decided what we’re going to do.”
Heavy top-down management structure can often lead to a lack of empowerment and innovation at the frontline of the business.

“How do we know it will work for sure?”
A culture that is risk averse, where the business does not encourage the need to fail to learn, will not prosper in innovation.

“Whatever it is, make sure it happens by 3pm.”
 A short term focus on execution with no time to think about the future gets us caught up in the urgency rather than the quality.

“Just let me know if you come up with anything.”
 A lack of process or methods will not help to bring ideas to fruition.

“If it’s not going to make us money tomorrow why are we doing it?”
A focus on immediate financial returns rather than a long term financial vision is a short sighted approach to any innovation strategy.

“They got so lucky with that one!”
Assuming innovation happens by accident means you’re never really focusing on making it happen</div>
		<div>“What’s the point, they never listen anyway?”
When there is no incentive to innovate, it doesn’t happen. Whether it’s acknowledgement or reward, you have to drive the want.

“Please do not post personal photos on cubicle walls.”
Often our physical environment fails to encourage creativity and collaboration.

“I do my bit well.”
When we focus too much on specialisation of skills we can sometimes miss opportunities to collaborate and connect our ideas.

“But we’ve always done it like this.”
This shows resistance to change and a business that can’t reach ‘the hearts and minds’ of their team members.

“If people had ideas, they’d say something.”
Assuming you’re hearing what people are thinking is exactly when you know you have no real idea.

 “Just put Dave in charge of it.”
 Innovation that’s delegated doesn’t get the full focus it deserves.</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS ••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>There was a time when your search for a new phone started and ended with Nokia. So, how does a company go from number one to least relevant, all in the space of a few years? There are many articles and studies about the subject, but the clear message seems to be their unwillingness to embrace drastic change. They saw the future but couldn’t; or wouldn’t, build it.

 Take a look at the following article from The New Yorker business magazine that explains where Nokia went wrong.</div>
		<div>CHAPTER PROGRESS ••••••••••••••</div>
		<div>Wanting something isn’t the same as being ready for it. It’s important to ensure that everyone in the business, including the business itself, is ready for innovation. Deciding on your innovation strategy may be about incremental change now, and the big breakthrough stuff later, rather than an ‘all in and hope for the best’ approach.

In a 2011 report, ‘Demystifying Innovation’, industry-focused assurance, tax and advisory services business, PWC developed a framework for thinking about what you need to do to improve, or begin, your innovation journey.
